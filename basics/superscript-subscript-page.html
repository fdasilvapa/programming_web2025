    <p>Water is a chemical compound composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen <br>
        atom, represented by the molecular formula H<sub>2</sub>O. This notation indicates that <br>
        each molecule of water consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms bonded to a single <br>
        oxygen (O) atom. The structure of H<sub>2</sub>O allows it to form hydrogen bonds, giving <br>
        water its unique properties such as high surface tension, excellent solvent capabilities,<br>
        and the ability to exist in all three states of matter—solid, liquid, and gas—under <br>
        natural Earth conditions.
